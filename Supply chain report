Just wrapped up another Power BI project! ðŸŽ‰ This time, I worked on a Supply Chain Dashboard, helping the client gain better visibility into their operations, optimize inventory management, and improve decision-making with real-time insights. ðŸ“Š

**Key Insights from the Supply Chain Dashboard
1.Overall Inventory Overview:
Track total inventory, average stock, and product count using KPI cards and visualizations.

2.Time Series Analysis:
Identify seasonality and sudden inventory changes through daily/monthly trends.

3.Product Performance & Stock Levels:
Detect products with low stock or consistently high inventory for better stock management.

4.Low Stock / Reorder Analysis:
Highlight products below reorder level to ensure timely restocking.

5.Supplier Performance:
Analyze which suppliers frequently have low-stock products to assess reliability.

6.Warehouse Distribution:
Monitor inventory allocation across warehouses and identify stock variance.

7.Category Breakdown:
Evaluate inventory distribution by category (e.g., Electronics, Furniture) to spot imbalances.

8.Variance & Anomaly Detection:
Identify unexpected stock fluctuations and anomalies for proactive decision-making.

9.Trend Comparison:
Compare current stock vs. reorder level trends to optimize inventory planning.

10.Inventory Efficiency Metrics (Advanced):
Measure inventory turnover and stock efficiency if sales data is available.

Additional Features:
Interactive Filters (Date, Product, Category, Supplier, Warehouse)
Drill-down Options (From category to specific product details)
Tooltips for Detailed Insight
