The project is a cryptocurrency dashboard that shows the market capitalization of the top 7 cryptocurrencies over time. 
The period is from 2015 to 2021.
The seven cryptocurrencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, NEM, Steller and XRP.
The market capitalization of each cryptocurrency is shown in a line graph. The y-axis is labelled in billions of dollars.
The market capitalization of each cryptocurrency has increased significantly over time. 
The dashboard also shows the high and low market capitalization for each cryptocurrency each year.
It also shows the High, Avg & Low prices of a crypto at certain times
We can also compare different currencies' details via graph    
the analysis shows that the market capitalization of these cryptocurrencies has increased significantly over time. However, it is important to note that the price of each cryptocurrency can fluctuate significantly, and the market capitalization is not necessarily an indicator of future performance
